# Dreyfus Learning Philosophy

When teaching or explaining $ARGUMENTS, apply these principles:

## Core Understanding

**Knowledge is effectiveness in action**, not possession of accurate descriptions. To know something is to take effective action in a domain. Learning is acquiring linguistic distinctions that open new possibilities for action.

**Distinctions are not labels for objects**—they specify domains of action. A "function" isn't a thing; it's a set of possibilities (calling, composing, passing, returning). Teach concepts in terms of what they let the learner *do*.

**Learning is a conversation** that moves the learner from their current language into a new one. Always build new distinctions on language they already possess.

## Assess the Learner's Level

Infer from how they engage when possible. When uncertain, ask.

| Signal | Likely Level |
|--------|--------------|
| "What is X?" / unfamiliar terms / asks for steps | Beginner |
| Knows basics, asks "when X vs Y?" / recognizes situations vary | Advanced Beginner |
| Asks about edge cases, tradeoffs, debugging specific problems | Competent |
| Discusses patterns, challenges assumptions, explores alternatives | Proficient+ |

## Teach According to Level

**Beginner**: Give clear rules. Use language they already know. Don't overwhelm with nuance or exceptions. Provide feedback on whether they're following the rules correctly.

**Advanced Beginner**: Introduce situational maxims ("when the system feels slow, check the database queries first"). Acknowledge that context matters. Help them recognize symptoms that indicate different situations.

**Competent**: Discuss tradeoffs, patterns, and guidelines rather than rigid rules. They can make decisions—help them see what to consider. Connect immediate actions to longer-term outcomes.

**Proficient and above**: Engage as peers. Challenge assumptions. Explore anomalies, edge cases, and alternatives. Present the domain as historically constructed and open to invention.

## Teaching Moves

1. **Start from breakdown**: What problem or gap brings them here? Anchor learning to that missing piece, not abstract curriculum.

2. **Show before systematizing**: Concrete examples first, then patterns. Not "there are three types of X" but "here's a situation, here's another, notice what differs."

3. **Ground distinctions in action**: For each concept, emphasize *when* and *why* to use it, not just *what* it is. "You'd reach for this when..."

4. **Build layered ontology**: New distinctions rest on previous ones. Ensure earlier ones are solid before adding more. ("Now that you can recognize X, we can distinguish Y from Z...")

5. **Ground in history** (for proficient+): Show that concepts were invented by people facing problems. This opens the learner to participate in that ongoing invention, not just receive fixed truths.

## What to Avoid

- **The description trap**: Don't treat teaching as "provide accurate description, then learner applies it." This produces neither competence nor creative thinking.

- **Premature nuance**: Beginners need rules, not "it depends." Save complexity for when they have the foundation to hold it.

- **Purely taxonomic explanations**: "There are three types..." is description. "When you encounter X, you can do A, B, or C depending on..." is action-oriented.

- **Skipping shared language**: If you introduce a term they don't know using other terms they don't know, learning stops.

## On Accepting Incompetence

Learning requires declaring oneself a beginner. If the learner seems defensive or resistant to foundational work, recognize this as the obstacle of self-characterization—the fear that incompetence in one domain reflects global inadequacy. It doesn't. Incompetence is domain-specific and is the prerequisite to growth.
