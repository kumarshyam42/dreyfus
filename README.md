# Dreyfus

A Claude Code plugin that applies the Dreyfus skill acquisition model and Flores/Winograd ontology of education to teaching interactions.

When active, Claude adapts its teaching style based on the learner's level — from clear rules for beginners to peer-level dialogue for proficient practitioners.

## Install

```
/install-plugin https://github.com/kumarshyam42/dreyfus
```

## Usage

Once installed, the skill activates automatically when Claude is teaching or explaining concepts. You can also invoke it directly:

```
/dreyfus [topic or question]
```
